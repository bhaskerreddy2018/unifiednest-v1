So basically i want to build an erp platform that consists of 
onboarding / calendar /leave /project /payroll / tasks / worklogs / chat /assets /expenses  and some more modules ( one app for small to medium scale companies ) .
many small to medium scale companies use multiple platforms to manage organization .we need to build version 1 of this app.
i want to build v1 of this idea with php / js / mysql / css framework .
 suggest me implementation and file structure . and any simple php classes like orm that can be used here for simple dev


 note:
 I don't prefer to use composer , because i'm on shared hosting , but its ok if direct library is available , i will directly put it in vendor ,
and i don't want to use php artisan serve or other commands for running app and similarly for router can i directly follow this structure and upload that class in vendor?

Recommended CSS Framework
For quick development with good-looking UI and easy customization:

Use: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

Tailwind for layout and utility

DaisyUI for beautiful, pre-built components like modals, navbars, alerts, etc.

âœ… 2. PHP Libraries/Classes for Simple Development
Use lightweight libraries instead of full-stack frameworks like Laravel to keep it simple in V1.

ðŸ”¸ ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
Medoo â€“ Lightweight PHP ORM (single file, easy to use)

PDO (PHP Data Object) â€“ Native and clean, if you want more control.

ðŸ”¸ Routing
AltoRouter â€“ Simple and powerful PHP router.

ðŸ”¸ Template Engine (Optional)
Plates â€“ Native PHP templating engine (faster than Twig, no new syntax to learn)

medoo , AltoRouter are installed in project .
and need to use accordians , modals where required 

roles : employee , manager ,hr , finance , department-owner , organization-owner , super-admin

there will be multiple organizations in the company
and multiple departments for an organization .

create a neat project structure 
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Application core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/             # Database and app configs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/               # Base classes (Router, Controller, DB)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/        # PHP controllers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/             # ORM or DB access classes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/              # HTML/PHP templates
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ modules/            # Each ERP module
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ calendar/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ leave/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ payroll/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...             # etc.
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ storage/                # Logs, uploads
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ vendor/                 # Composer packages
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .env    


//module structue
calendar/
â”œâ”€â”€ CalendarController.php
â”œâ”€â”€ CalendarModel.php
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ calendar_list.php
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ calendar_form.php
â””â”€â”€ routes.php

step 1 . create a folder db and .sql file with all necessary tables and also create a file that displays all tables structure in formated way . whenever table is updated in .sql file , need to update that formatted file too for better understanding
step 2 . lets start with login and register ( we will disable direct register after first registration and we will consider first user as super admin ) . admin can create new user and user needs to login and complete on boarding with basic , family , education , health , address and contact , experience details
step 3 . create user pages dashboard ( ongoing tasks of user , notifications (pending leaves ,resignations ..ets) , birthdays , user calendar (display total month and on every date populate the user activity . if user is on leave then leave ,similar for  hoilday or project task ) ) use calendar as common component
step 4 . project management ( view (basic info and top ongoing tasks ) , update (edit , add resources into project , add documents , billing ) , create project )
step 4 . task management ( basic jira like module .) create / update / view tickets . add comments / documents , worklogs
step 5 . leave management 
step 6 . timesheets ( auto timehseet sync from worklogs and auto timesheet for leave)
step 7 . payroll management ( basic payslips generation based on timehseets ).
step 8 . profile management (  basic ,family , education , health , address and contact , experience details)

lets build step by step
